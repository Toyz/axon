# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current templates.go file in the internal/templates package has several critical issues that make it difficult to maintain and prone to bugs. The file contains hardcoded template strings that generate Go code, but it's missing proper import management, has formatting issues, and lacks modularity. This refactor will address these issues by restructuring the template system to be more maintainable, testable, and reliable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Axon framework, I want the template generation system to properly handle Go imports, so that generated code compiles without missing import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating interface templates THEN the system SHALL automatically include required standard library imports like "context"
2. WHEN generating module templates THEN the system SHALL properly format import statements with correct newlines and grouping
3. WHEN a template references types from other packages THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and include the necessary imports
4. WHEN generating code with multiple import groups THEN the system SHALL separate standard library, third-party, and local imports with blank lines

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with the template system, I want templates to be better organized and more maintainable, so that they are easier to read, modify, and debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates are defined THEN they SHALL be organized by functionality with clear separation between different template types
2. WHEN template constants become too large THEN they SHALL be broken down into smaller, more focused templates
3. WHEN template logic is duplicated THEN it SHALL be extracted into reusable helper functions
4. WHEN debugging template issues THEN the template structure SHALL make it easy to identify the source of problems

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer debugging generated code issues, I want the template system to have proper error handling and validation, so that I can quickly identify and fix template-related problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN template execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which template and what data caused the failure
2. WHEN template data is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate required fields before attempting template execution
3. WHEN generated code would be malformed THEN the system SHALL detect and report formatting issues
4. WHEN templates reference undefined variables THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with generated code, I want the template system to reuse existing import statements from the source files and extend them as needed, so that import handling is reliable and consistent with the original code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing source files THEN the system SHALL capture and preserve all existing import statements from the original Go files
2. WHEN generating autogen modules THEN the system SHALL include all imports from the source files that are referenced in the generated code
3. WHEN additional imports are needed for generated code THEN the system SHALL add them to the existing import list without duplicating
4. WHEN organizing imports in generated files THEN the system SHALL maintain proper Go import grouping (standard library, third-party, local) and formatting
5. WHEN copying imports from source files THEN the system SHALL only include imports that are actually used in the generated code to avoid unused import errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working with the code generation system, I want templates to produce properly formatted Go code, so that generated files are readable and follow Go conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is generated THEN it SHALL be properly formatted according to Go standards (gofmt compatible)
2. WHEN generating function signatures THEN parameter lists SHALL be properly formatted with correct spacing
3. WHEN generating struct initialization THEN field assignments SHALL be properly indented and aligned
4. WHEN generating import blocks THEN they SHALL follow Go import grouping and sorting conventions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with templates, I want a better template loading and management system, so that templates are easier to find, modify, and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates are stored THEN they SHALL be organized in a clear, logical structure that makes them easy to locate
2. WHEN loading templates THEN the system SHALL support both embedded templates and external template files for flexibility
3. WHEN templates are modified THEN the system SHALL provide clear mechanisms for reloading or updating templates
4. WHEN debugging template issues THEN it SHALL be easy to identify which template file or section is causing problems

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the template system, I want comprehensive test coverage for all template functions, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN template functions are implemented THEN they SHALL have unit tests covering normal operation
2. WHEN template functions handle edge cases THEN they SHALL have tests covering error conditions and boundary cases
3. WHEN templates generate code THEN the generated output SHALL be validated for correctness in tests
4. WHEN template helper functions are added THEN they SHALL have isolated unit tests demonstrating their behavior
