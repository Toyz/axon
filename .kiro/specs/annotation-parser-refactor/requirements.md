# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current annotation parsing system in Axon is fragile and error-prone. We need to create a robust, extensible annotation parsing library that can handle complex annotation syntax with proper validation, type safety, and clear error messages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Robust Annotation Parsing

**User Story:** As a developer using Axon annotations, I want the parser to handle complex annotation syntax correctly so that I don't encounter cryptic errors due to parsing inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write an annotation with flags like `//axon::core -Mode=Transient` THEN the parser SHALL correctly extract the Mode parameter as "Transient"
2. WHEN I write an annotation with multiple flags like `//axon::route GET /users/{id:int} -Middleware=Auth,Logging -PassContext` THEN the parser SHALL correctly extract all flags and parameters
3. WHEN I write an annotation with quoted values like `//axon::core -Module="Custom Module Name"` THEN the parser SHALL handle quoted strings correctly
4. WHEN I write an annotation with boolean flags like `//axon::core -Init` THEN the parser SHALL recognize it as a boolean flag
5. WHEN I write malformed annotations THEN the parser SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 2: Type-Safe Parameter Handling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want annotation parameters to be type-safe so that I can catch configuration errors at parse time rather than runtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define an annotation schema THEN the parser SHALL validate parameter types according to the schema
2. WHEN I provide an invalid parameter type THEN the parser SHALL return a descriptive error message
3. WHEN I provide required parameters THEN the parser SHALL validate their presence
4. WHEN I provide optional parameters THEN the parser SHALL use default values when not specified
5. WHEN I access parsed parameters THEN they SHALL be properly typed (string, bool, int, []string, etc.)

### Requirement 3: Extensible Annotation System

**User Story:** As a framework developer, I want to easily define new annotation types with their own parameter schemas so that the system can grow without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I define a new annotation type THEN I SHALL be able to specify its parameter schema declaratively
2. WHEN I register a new annotation type THEN the parser SHALL automatically validate it according to its schema
3. WHEN I need custom validation logic THEN I SHALL be able to provide custom validators
4. WHEN I parse annotations THEN the system SHALL only accept registered annotation types
5. WHEN I extend existing annotation types THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 4: Clear Error Reporting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages when my annotations are malformed so that I can quickly fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have a syntax error in an annotation THEN the parser SHALL show the exact location and nature of the error
2. WHEN I have a parameter validation error THEN the parser SHALL show what was expected vs what was provided
3. WHEN I have multiple errors THEN the parser SHALL report all errors at once rather than stopping at the first one
4. WHEN I have an error THEN the parser SHALL suggest possible fixes when applicable
5. WHEN I have an error THEN the parser SHALL include file name and line number information

### Requirement 5: Performance and Efficiency

**User Story:** As a developer working on large codebases, I want annotation parsing to be fast so that code generation doesn't slow down my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I parse a large number of files THEN the parser SHALL complete in reasonable time (< 1 second for 100 files)
2. WHEN I parse the same files multiple times THEN the parser SHALL cache results when possible
3. WHEN I have syntax errors THEN the parser SHALL fail fast without processing unnecessary files
4. WHEN I parse annotations THEN memory usage SHALL be reasonable and not leak
5. WHEN I run the parser concurrently THEN it SHALL be thread-safe

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer with existing Axon annotations, I want the new parser to work with my existing code so that I don't have to rewrite all my annotations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I have existing `//axon::core` annotations THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification
2. WHEN I have existing `//axon::route` annotations THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification
3. WHEN I have existing `//axon::controller` annotations THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification
4. WHEN I have existing `//axon::middleware` annotations THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification
5. WHEN I upgrade to the new parser THEN no breaking changes SHALL be introduced to existing annotation syntax
